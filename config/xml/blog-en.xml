				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The holidays are a busy time of year for everyone, but e-store owners have the added challenge of managing a thriving business in the midst of holiday madness. The extra pressure can build up fast and take its toll. No one needs to get sick or have a nervous breakdown a week before Christmas. Here are a few simple ways to take care of yourself during the holidays.<br />
<span id="more-20982"></span><br />
<em>On the first day of Christmas&#8230;Schedule your time.</em><br />
It’s tempting to devote your days and nights to your business at the holidays&#8211;this is the most important time of the year after all, right? But you won’t be efficient glued to your screen 16 hours a day. Plan chunks of time to get specific tasks done, and plan time to spend with family, friends, or just relaxing. You need a balance to be productive.</p>
<p><em>On the second day of Christmas&#8230;Plan workouts.</em><br />
Whether it’s shoveling snow or going for a jog, you need to keep moving! Exercise keeps your mood up and the eggnog calories off.</p>
<p><em>On the third day of Christmas&#8230;Get up and move around.</em><br />
It’s just as important to get up and take regular breaks while you’re working as it is to schedule exercise. Flex those knees and stretch out those wrists!</p>
<p><em>On the fourth day of Christmas&#8230;Eat healthy. </em><br />
It’s difficult this time of year, but try to resist overindulging in holiday treats. Keep healthy snacks like veggie sticks and low-fat yoghurt around if you plan on putting in a few extra hours. Save the desserts for meal times and special moments.</p>
<p><em>On the fifth day of Christmas…Put your computer away.</em><br />
Yes, you are allowed to unplug during the holidays. Set aside blocks of time to shut down your computer and forget about work. When you log back on, you’ll be refreshed and focused. Setting boundaries in this way will make you more efficient at work and more present during social time.</p>
<p><em>On the sixth day of Christmas…Drink water.</em><br />
Sorry if we sound like your mother, but yes, you do need to drink 8 glasses or about 1.5 liters of water a day to stay healthy and alert. This is even more important if your December tends to be awash in bubbly.</p>
<p><em>On the seventh day of Christmas…Communicate.</em><br />
Stay in touch with your customers and communicate early if you see weather or supply-related delays on the horizon. Being proactive will protect you from customer ire and make managing the post-holiday exchange and return period less stressful.</p>
<p><em>On the eighth day of Christmas…Prioritize</em><br />
Not everything is going to make or break your holiday performance, so prioritize and get the essentials done first. Then, if you have the time and motivation, do a few less important tasks. But stay realistic, or you’ll miss out on what the holidays are really about: friends, family and sugar cookies, lots of sugar cookies.</p>
<p><em>On the ninth day of Christmas…Meditate.</em><br />
Take some time for yourself, even if it’s just ten or twenty minutes in the morning or at the end of the day. Settle down in a quiet spot and focus on your breath to quiet your mind and let go of whatever stress is currently weighing you down. Meditation won’t make your problems go away, but you’ll be better prepared to tackle them after a moment of calm and self-care.</p>
<p><em>On the tenth day of Christmas…Get up early.</em><br />
The early bird gets the worm&#8230;and she gets to enjoy the rest of the day with a clear conscience. If you can get up at 5 or 6 o’clock in the morning, you’ll have two or three hours of calm before the rest of the world gets going. If you concentrate on getting a maximum of work done then, you’ll have more than enough time for a nap in front of the fireplace later on.</p>
<p><em>On the eleventh day of Christmas…Volunteer.</em><br />
Volunteering is not everyone’s cup of tea, but it can be a great opportunity to step back and see the big picture. Your business is important, but it’s just one aspect of your life. You’re part of a community that keeps your business alive and giving back feels great. Volunteering is also an opportunity to spend meaningful time with friends and family, which will also help keep your stress in check.</p>
<p><em>On the twelfth day of Christmas&#8230;Say no.</em><br />
Sometimes the best thing to do is simply to not do. It’s okay if you can’t get it all done. You’re better off saying no to an invitation or rescheduling a non-vital task to tomorrow if trying to fit everything in is going to leave you frazzled. The holidays are important because they generate a lot of revenue, but don’t let that become such an obsession that it ruins the rest of the experience.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The holidays are over&#8211;phew! But that doesn’t mean your work is! Smart ecommerce business owners will take this opportunity to rocket into 2016 with the same energy that got them record sales in 2015. The truth is, though, many merchants check out after Christmas, resulting in the dreaded post-holiday slump. Don’t let that happen to you. Read on to discover our suggestions for extending the holiday cheer all the way into the new year.</p>
<p><span id="more-19408"></span></p>
<p>Here are a few alternative ideas to ensure healthy business after the holiday rush, and cultivate good relationships with new and existing customers.</p>
<h2 style="color: #5e8f71;">Returns and exchanges</h2>
<p>Your customers are burnt out from the holidays and dreading the entire return-and-exchange process. If you can make the experience easy, or better yet, pleasant for them, you can turn this dreary aspect of the holidays into an opportunity to build customer loyalty.</p>
<p><strong>Unsatisfied customers are people too</strong><br />
You worked hard to deck out your online shop for the holidays and make sure your customers had a stellar experience. Don&#8217;t stop now; returns and exchanges may not be fun, but they provide a great opportunity to impress your customers with attentive, personalized service.</p>
<p><strong>Lend a listening ear with instant chat</strong><br />
The best way to ease the returns and exchange process is to have a simple policy clearly stated on your shop site. Back this up with enhanced <span style="text-decoration: underline;">live chat</span> capabilities—this is your chance to show off your customer service skills with friendly, real-time help. As an added bonus, personalize your live chat windows with photos of real people, not stock shots.</p>
<p><strong>Reduce returns with an incentive they can&#8217;t refuse</strong><br />
Looked at in another light, a return can be a great opportunity to convert a long-term customer. Why not offer free shipping or a modest discount if the customer decides to make an exchange instead of asking for a refund? They get a pleasant surprise and you get renewed business.</p>
<h2 style="color: #5e8f71;">Deals and discounts that make a difference</h2>
<p>We wouldn&#8217;t usually tell you to compete on price, but the holiday and post-holiday period is a unique time when customers expect discounts. That doesn&#8217;t mean you have to do what everyone else is doing; find a unique way to stand out as customers get ready to spend their Christmas loot and cash in on gift cards. Try one of these:</p>
<p><strong>Give back a bit of what you get</strong><br />
An interesting way to differentiate yourself is to give a portion of proceeds to a charity you support. After months in the consumerist tornado that is the holiday season, many people are happy to see some of their money support a good cause.</p>
<p><strong>Buy one, get this free</strong><br />
If you’ve got excess inventory to move, consider offering a free product with the purchase of a full-price item. This works very well with perishable or time-sensitive products, like seasonal fashion items: throw in a printed scarf for every pair of full-price jeans purchased. Even if you only break even on those items, you’ve saved yourself invenotry costs and shelf space by moving products that would have otherwise gone to waste.</p>
<p><strong>Bundle up</strong><br />
If you have complimentary products that you need to get rid of, consider bundling them and targeting customers who bought a related item. Accessories and refills are great candidates for this move: picks and strings for a new guitar; chargers, adapters and cases for phones. Mix and match to see what works for your business.</p>
<p><strong>A good old-fashioned contest</strong><br />
Drum up interest with a contest: ask customers to submit their favorite holiday photos or best image of your product in use. Everyone who participates wins, even if it’s just 5% off their next purchase. Use the contest to promote a new or best-selling product and award one to the winner.</p>
<p><strong>Say thank you</strong><br />
Your store’s success leans heavily on customer loyalty, so why not thank your customers for making your year a great one? Offer them a small discount that they can pass on to friends and family. It’ll give them a reason to visit your store in January and maybe even attract a few new visitors.</p>
<p><strong>The undiscount: a new product for the new year</strong><br />
A new product launch is a great way to get customers’ attention without slashing prices. You’ll need to be organized to pull it off, but if you do it right, you can take advantage of new year momentum to make a big impact.</p>
<h2 style="color: #5e8f71;">Lessons and resolutions</h2>
<p>The post-holiday season is also a good time to take stock of the past year in order to prepare for the one coming up. While you’ll certainly be discounting some items and working to clear inventory for new products, it’s important to take the time to do important marketing work that will put you on track for the NEXT holiday season.</p>
<p><strong>Mind your data</strong><br />
The holiday season should have given you a wealth of data about your customers. You can use it to segment your contact list and push personalized offers on products you want to move to the customers you’re sure will be interested. For example, if you know who bought a phone this year, send an email offering an accessory bundle. Or if you’re an apparel store with excess items in a few select sizes, send targeted offers to customers you know have bought those sizes previously. You avoid swamping customers with offers that won’t interest them.</p>
<p><strong>Pay attention to purchasing patterns</strong><br />
You’ll have learned a lot about your customers this holiday season, but also quite a bit about your products. What is selling full price? What goes on sale? Use this data to tailor your marketing and evaluate which products you should be marking down to move and which are going to carry you through the year.</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
<li><strong style="color: #5e8f71;">Well-performing products:</strong> The holidays probably gave you a good idea of what products people are willing to pay full price for. These are good items to build bundles and promotions around now and to focus marketing efforts on throughout the year.</li>
<li><strong style="color: #5e8f71;">Products with promise:</strong> Do some products attract a lot of attention but few conversions? Try promoting them with a light post-holiday sale or simply put them in the spotlight when you communicate with customers.</li>
<li><strong style="color: #5e8f71;">Troubled products:</strong> if certain products only sell well at a discount it might be time to clear them out. Post-holiday sales are a great opportunity to make a special “Clearance” category. These are products that might also bundle well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Don’t neglect abandoned carts</strong><br />
Many customers use carts in lieu of a wish list. They often expect to receive a reminder about their cart, so don’t miss this opportunity to follow up and recoup unfinished sales.</p>
<p><strong>Show off your social skills </strong><br />
The holidays may be over, but don’t shelve your marketing efforts just yet. Use social media to keep the conversation going. If you decide to incorporate a charity donation, social media is a great way to engage your customers and raise awareness. The same goes for if you hold a post-holiday contest.</p>
<p><strong>Take down the holiday decorations (and deals!)</strong><br />
This is one that’s easy to do, but also easy to overlook. Unfortunately, the consequences of forgetting could be unpleasant for your reputation and your bottom line. If you promised free shipping during the holidays, be sure to remove it from your promotional tools if you don’t plan on continuing in the new year. Did you make a low-price guarantee during the holidays that your post-holiday sale is going to conflict with? Do this now so you can move on to more important things.</p>
<h2 style="color: #5e8f71;">Key takeaways</h2>
<ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
<li>Personalize the returns and exchange process</li>
<li>Use incentives to convert returns into exchanges or even purchases</li>
<li>Avoid relying solely on deep discounts; make creative offers</li>
<li>Thank your customers</li>
<li>Use data to segment customers and target marketing efforts</li>
<li>Analyze product performance and market accordingly</li>
<li>Follow up on abandoned cards</li>
<li>Be social in the new year</li>
<li>Review holiday promises and take down decorations</li>
</ul>
<p>The holidays are over, but the new year is just beginning. What are you doing to make sure it’s a successful one? Have you tried any of these suggestions? Let us know what’s working for you!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Today Leah Hamilton from Terms Feed gives us the low-down on how to avoid spamming customers during the holiday season.</em></p>
<p>At holiday time, when you’re sending out mailers, special deals, and seasonal sales, the name of the game is to market your product, and market hard. The winter holidays are the biggest spending season of the year, and it’s highly likely that <a href="http://www.marketingcharts.com/online/marketers-continue-to-rate-email-the-most-effective-digital-marketing-tactic-46295/" target="_blank">email marketing </a>will be one of your primary methods of reaching your customers. Given the crucial importance of marketing at this time, it’s important to remember to comply with anti-spam legislation when you carry out your marketing plan.</p>
<p>First we’ll take a look at why Christmas and holiday-season marketing is so important for your business, then look at how to make sure you get it right, legally.<br />
<span id="more-20950"></span></p>
<h2 style="color: #5c69af">Marketing in the Holiday Season</h2>
<p>The winter holiday season is definitely the most lucrative of the year; and it’s not just Christmas, either: more than 90 percent of Americans celebrated Christmas, Kwanza or Hanukah in 2014, and spent an <a href="http://research.nrffoundation.com/Default.aspx?pg=9003#.U2E-1_ldVyw" target="_blank">average of $730</a> on gifts, food, and decorations. Check out the graph from the National Retail Federation that shows just how far ahead the winter holidays are:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20952" alt="holiday-spending-totals" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/12/holiday-spending-totals.png" width="674" height="573" /></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 13px">Image: NRF Consumer Holiday Spending USA (<a href="https://nrf.com/news/the-long-and-short-of-americas-consumer-holidays" target="_blank">https://nrf.com/news/the-long-and-short-of-americas-consumer-holidays</a>)</em></p>
<p>It’s easy to see why merchants ramp up their marketing efforts this time of year: everyone is on the lookout for gifts for friends and family, special deals and themed products. Marketers need to capitalize on this opportunity by sending out their latest specials, catalogues and holiday-themed emails. Given the importance of the holiday season to many people, getting it right means an opportunity to build customer loyalty and a chance to capitalize on goodwill.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to make sure that holiday marketing is done right. Here’s where CAN-SPAM and other pieces of anti-spam law come in. First let’s take a look at the anti-spam legislation in the US, as well as the UK and Europe, and then we’ll look at some holiday examples of how to comply.</p>
<h2 style="color: #5c69af">What Are the Key Pieces of Anti-Spam Legislation?</h2>
<h4>Anti-Spam in Europe and the UK</h4>
<p>In Europe, anti-spam rules are covered by the <a href="http://www.email-marketing-reports.com/canspam/eu/" target="_blank">Privacy and Electronic Communication Directive</a>, issued in 2002. EU Member States are expected to implement this Directive in their own local laws. The UK has done this by way of the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/online/spam-emails/" target="_blank">Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003</a>, which sets out a number of rules that must be followed when sending out marketing emails.</p>
<p>First, to email or market to someone who isn’t already a customer, you must offer them a chance to <a href="https://termsfeed.com/blog/legal-mistakes-uk-email-marketing/" target="_blank">opt in explicitly</a>. Here’s an example of what an explicit opt-in looks like:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20953" alt="join-our-mailing-list" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/12/join-our-mailing-list.png" width="880" height="603" /></p>
<p><em>Image: <a href="https://www.katespade.com/katespade-customer-service-your-account/join-mailing-list.html" target="_blank">Kate Spade Mailing List</a></em></p>
<p>You can see in the image above that Kate Spade asks for an email address and for the user to click a “Join” button before product announcements, promotions or sales reminders are sent to the customer. They also include a link to their privacy policy and terms of use, which is good practice.</p>
<p>UK anti-spam law also allows something called a <a href="http://www.lawdonut.co.uk/law/sales-and-marketing/marketing-and-advertising/your-email-marketing-and-anti-spam-law" target="_blank">soft opt-in</a>. This soft opt-in allows you to treat a customer as if they have consented to receiving emails from you, even though they actually haven’t. To comply with the soft opt-in allowance you need to:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li>Have <strong>obtained the customer’s email address “in the course of the sale of negotiations for the sale of a product or service.”</strong> This means that the person has to be already a customer, and you can’t just email random people.</li>
<li><strong>Only email those people in relation to “similar products and services.”</strong> So if your customers signed up to receive jewellery newsletters from you, you can’t send them advertisements for gardening supplies.</li>
<li><strong>Give the person a method of refusing the use of his or her contact details</strong> at the time they initially provide them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like US law (which we’ll discuss below) UK law also requires that you give your customers an opportunity to opt-out of emails that you send them. The option to unsubscribe must be <strong>easily visible, and displayed on every email</strong>.</p>
<h4>CAN-SPAM and the US</h4>
<p>In the US, the primary governing law is CAN-SPAM. CAN-SPAM stands for <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business" target="_blank">Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing Act of 2003</a>, and it is a piece of legislation that sets the rules for commercial emails, such as holiday advertisements.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business" target="_blank">main requirements of CAN-SPAM</a> are:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li>Don’t use misleading header information in your emails. For instance, don’t change your “From” text to say that your name is “National Hospital” when it (clearly) isn’t. Your email address and domain name should be accurate.</li>
<li>Don’t use deceptive subject lines. Don’t use “Fwd:” or “Re:” in your email header just to make it look more like your recipient has already contacted you. Or alternatively, if your email is a marketing email about your product, don’t make your subject line “URGENT: Mom ill!” Your subject line should accurately reflect the contact of your email.</li>
<li>If you are sending marketing messages, you must identify your message as an advertisement in some way.</li>
<li>You must notify your recipients of where you are located. In particular, you must provide a valid physical postal address (e.g. street address, PO box, private mailbox).</li>
<li>Include opt-out information for your recipients.</li>
<li>Honor any opt-out requests. You must do this within 10 business days, and there must not be a fee for your recipient to opt out.</li>
<li>If someone else is sending marketing emails on your behalf, you must monitor what they are doing and ensure that they comply with the law.</li>
</ul>
<p>This law is enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (<strong>FTC</strong>), and if a person or organisation does not comply, they may be subject to <a href="https://sendgrid.com/blog/can-spam-compliance-breaking/" target="_blank">penalties of up to ,000</a> for each email in violation. Both the company whose product is promoted in the message, and the company who sent the message may be legally responsible.</p>
<h2 style="color: #5c69af">How to comply</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at some examples of Christmas mailers that comply with the laws above.</p>
<p>Here’s an example from <a href="http://www.pumpkinpatch.co.nz/" target="_blank">Pumpkin Patch</a> kidswear that shows the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20951" alt="pumpkin-patch" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/12/pumpkin-patch.png" width="525" height="507" /></p>
<p>You can see that Pumpkin Patch has a link to what is essentially a preferences page, where the email recipient can change their account preferences and unsubscribe from email advertisements. It’s ok to either provide a direct unsubscribe link, or send your customers to their preferences page to do so, as Pumpkin Patch has done.</p>
<p>Next let’s take a look at an example from <a href="http://www.bhcosmetics.com/" target="_blank">BH Cosmetics</a>. In the example below you can see that BH Cosmetics has included their physical address to notify recipients of their location.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20954" alt="last-day-to-ship" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/12/last-day-to-ship.png" width="722" height="446" /></p>
<p>Finally, the last example from the <a href="https://www.portablenorthpole.com/en/" target="_blank">Portable North Pole</a> shows appropriate headers and subject lines, as well as clearly indicating that the email is an advertisement.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-20955" alt="newsletter-santa" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/12/newsletter-santa-1024x719.png" width="700" height="491" /></p>
<p>You can see that the subject line, the email “from” field, and email address are all correct and honest about who the email is coming from (Portable North Pole). In the message itself, the wording “fan offer” and “get your unlimited pass and enjoy Premium video messages” clearly indicate that this is an advertisement for customers to purchase a Premium video package as opposed to the free video messages that Portable North Pole offers.</p>
<h2 style="color: #5c69af">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Advertising in the holiday season is a great way to reach your customers and get them hooked on holiday deals, but make sure to comply with anti-spam laws in your country when you email them! By including an unsubscribe link in your emails, and staying honest and truthful in all communications, you’ll be well on your way to meeting the anti-spam requirements you’ll be subject to.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you crush your holiday sales this year? With 2015 rolling to a close, it’s already time to start planning for 2016. Have you considered expanding your audience beyond your borders to reach more potential customers? We’re helping you do just that with 3 ways to expand your business internationally in 2016.<br />
<span id="more-20942"></span></p>
<h2 style="color:#01bad9">1. Set up a multi-currency payment provider</h2>
<p>The first tool you’ll need to expand your business internationally is a payment provider that allows you to accept different currencies and process multiple payment options. Visa, MasterCard, Amex, Diners, JCB, Discover and PayPal are just a few of the popular payment options customers prefer. Next, it’s important to offer new or potential customers their preferred currency because not only are they more familiar with it, they incur fewer to no fees when they complete translations. </p>
<p><a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/payments-gateways-prestashop-modules/18752-brinkscheckout.html" target="_blank">Brinks Checkout</a> is one of the <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/481-payment">payment methods</a> offered to PrestaShop customers. With <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/payments-gateways-prestashop-modules/18752-brinkscheckout.html" target="_blank">Brinks Checkout</a>, customers can sell in almost 200 countries, accept 26 currencies and is offered in 15 languages – all with one merchant account. Consider the number of customers you can reach by adding just this tool. Check out their Addons page for more details on their offer then download their <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/payments-gateways-prestashop-modules/18752-brinkscheckout.html" target="_blank">free module</a>.</p>
<p>BONUS: Use PrestaShop’s built-in localization features to translate your entire website to convert even more of your new international customer base. Simply navigate to your back office &gt; localization &gt; translations &gt; add / update a language.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20944" alt="brinks_checkout" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/12/brinks_checkout.png" width="155" height="55" /></p>
<h2 style="color:#01bad9">2. Enable international shipping options</h2>
<p>The second tool you’ll need to expand your business internationally in 2016 is a reliable and affordable way to transport your goods to the eventual customer. A few important things to consider are: shipping pricing and customs processing. You’ll need to figure out how much shipping a product overseas will cost you. Then you’ll need to decide if you want to charge your customers the entire shipping cost or if you want to offer competitive shipping prices and cover the remaining cost yourself. Keep in mind that some carriers tack on additional surcharges to deliver the package overseas.</p>
<p>Next, you should prepare the necessary information for shipping overseas. Customs declaration forms should generally accompany packages that weigh more than a pound. Depending on your carrier, you may need to detail each product, their components, weights as well as price. Be sure to have all this handy to expedite your shipping process. Once you’ve shipped to a new country, be sure to note the amount of time it takes to deliver your package.</p>
<p>Stamps.com is a shipping option that can help expand your international shipping options and promote your shop’s growth. Learn more by checking out their <a href="http://blog.stamps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/complete-guide-usps-international-shipping.gif" target="_blank">international shipping infographic</a> or download their <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/shipping-logistics-delivery-prestashop-modules/20185-stampsdotcom.html" target="_blank">free module</a> to jump right in and get started. </p>

<h2 style="color:#01bad9">3. Meet new customers on marketplaces</h2>
<p>A great way to meet new potential customers is by listing your product on marketplaces like <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/marketplace-prestashop-modules/2742-ebay.html" target="_blank">eBay</a>. You can choose to list your entire product catalog or just the most popular products. For customers who aren’t too familiar with your shop or brand, it’s a quick way to ease into purchasing from you. They can shop on a platform they are used to. The only difference is that this particular product is shipped by you. </p>
<p>Marketplaces are a great way for merchants looking to expand internationally to test out their target markets. Before making large investments into additional inventory for your new segment, listing your product on eBay can help you determine if there is even a need for that product in your target market. Learn more about how you can <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/how-to-harness-ebay-for-cross-border-sales/">harness eBay for cross-border sales</a> then download the <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/marketplace-prestashop-modules/2742-ebay.html" target="_blank">free eBay module for PrestaShop</a> to get started. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you’ve just finished running a successful marketing campaign or have just come back from a successful event, chances are, you now have new leads for your shop. What’s next? Do you email them? What do you say? Today we’ll help you figure just what to do with them to improve your lead retention.<br />
<span id="more-20933"></span></p>
<h2>1. Qualify Leads</h2>
<p>The first step following lead acquisition is to qualify your leads. Where you did you acquire them from? Where are they currently in the purchase funnel? Three sample categories include: don&#8217;t know the brand, love the brand but haven&#8217;t purchased, new customer. By categorizing your leads, you’ll be able to craft a marketing message that is not only more relevant, but also engaging. </p>
<p>If customers just learned about your brand, they probably aren&#8217;t interested in all the updates you’ve made to an older version of your product. They don’t even know what your product was like before! Misaligned emails can also befuddle your existing customers. For example, sending an old customer a new campaign about your company might lead them to believe you’re changing your company. It’s why we highlight the importance of knowing exactly who you are talking to, so you can maximize the impact of the messages you send. </p>
<h2>2. Activation / Reactivation Campaign</h2>
<p>If you’re targeting those who don’t know your brand, your first step should be introducing them to what you sell. By aligning your message with the right audience, you increase the chances of retaining your customer longer. These activation campaigns aim to get customers interested in your brand and hopefully even engage your company. </p>
<p>If you’re leads are already customers, your goal is to get them to convert again, preferably in the form of a new purchase. If they purchased from you before, give them an incentive to make a purchase. As an added bonus for you, try to get feedback from customers by asking them to complete a survey. Once they provide feedback, they’ll be rewarded with a coupon to shop your site. </p>
<h2>3. Engagement Campaign</h2>
<p>Sometimes customers just aren’t ready to convert. Don&#8217;t discount these leads! Just because they haven’t made a purchase, it doesn’t mean they’re not interested in your business. Keep in touch with your customers by sending regular updates about your products or the latest trends in your industry. This is especially important during low sales seasons when other companies may not be engaging your customers.</p>
<p>Selling pet supplies? Touch base with pet lovers on days like National Dog Day or during <a href="http://www.dogtipper.com/fun/pet-holidays" target="_blank">related events</a> like <a href="http://www.crufts.org.uk/" target="_blank">Crufts</a>. It’s time to get creative to engage customers. There is no wrong or right approach, it’s all about building a relationship with your customers. </p>
<h2>4. Convert <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/respond-customer-feedback-boost-business/" style="font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', Tahoma,Verdana,sans-serif;font-size:28px;font-weight: 300">Complaints</a> into Hot Leads</h2>
<p>Hearing from customers is always a good thing, even in the form of angry <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/3-must-follow-rules-for-addressing-your-online-stores-customer-complaints/">customers complaining</a>. Every interaction or touch point of your brand is an opportunity to make a positive impact on your customers. If you can win them over when they are most upset with you, keeping them around will be a piece of cake. </p>
<p>First, listen carefully to customer concerns. They’re taking time to tell you about their problem, so give the courtesy of hearing them out. Stay objective by focusing on the facts and not on emotions. Next, try to find a resolution that works for both you and the customer. Try to deliver the solution in a timely fashion. For some examples and more tips on handling customer complaints, check out these ideas for <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/respond-customer-feedback-boost-business/">how to respond to customer feedback</a>.</p>
<h2>5. Run personalized campaigns</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a new batch of hot leads, there’s still something you can do to re-engage your audience. Most merchants only target customers during major holidays sales, as the majority of people tend to shop at this time. However, there’s a way to keep customers engaged throughout the year, specifically, one special day of the year for each of your customer &#8211; their birthday!</p>
<p>Birthdays are spread throughout the year, so you can kick off this campaign at anytime. Birthdays are about the customer, not you &#8211; so tailor your messages with that in mind. Try messages built on the idea of a birthday gift. Whether you offer a special discount code (like “MYBIRTHDAY” or a birthday gift card, this gesture (although generic) has the ability to feel very personal. </p>
<h2>It’s your turn</h2>
<p>Use one or all of our building blocks to turn your leads from cold to hot and keep them coming back:</p>
<ol>
<li>Qualify your leads</li>
<li>Try activation or reactivation campaigns</li>
<li>Engage customers</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The holiday season is upon us. You’ve decked out your homepage, planned your holiday promotions and set up a targeted communication plan to draw a maximum number of shoppers. This is the biggest revenue-generating time of the year after all. But what if, despite your greatest efforts, you don’t see an uptick in sales by early December? Don’t worry, all hope is not lost. We’ve put together a few technical tips to help you determine what might be going wrong on your site and a few marketing actions to boost sales.<br />
<span id="more-20920"></span><br />
<strong>Check on site speed.</strong> This is a busy time of year and shoppers are less patient than usual (which isn’t saying much). If your site takes more than 3 seconds to load, this could explain why you’re losing shoppers before check out. Make sure photos are optimized for the web. Get in touch with your hosting provider to let them know you’re expecting an uptick in traffic and <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/432-website-performance" target="_blank">make sure a simple technical glitch isn’t standing between you and out-of-the-park sales</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Identify problem pages.</strong> Use Google Analytics to identify 404 Error Pages that may be scaring away customers. Review your 404 Error message and make sure it’s reassuring, not cryptic and worrisome. Customers need to be assured they’re still on your site and not opening themselves up to viruses and malware.</p>
<p><strong>Verify your Adwords account.</strong> If you’re using paid advertising, double check your keywords, make sure everything is headed in the right direction. Since it’s the holidays, you might want to transfer budget to large cities that are commerce hubs, or specific customer segments. Just make sure everything is setup correctly, as a technical error could be what’s affecting your sales.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluate recent changes.</strong> If you’re not seeing traffic increase, or worse, you’re seeing a decrease during the holidays, take a minute to evaluate any changes you’ve made. You probably redid your homepage for the holidays and updated product pages. Did you overlook any important elements, like call to action buttons? Did you add complications to the sales funnel? Are your special offers and purchase triggers like free shipping clearly displayed on your site? Take time to analyze how your changes may have impacted traffic. </p>
<p><strong>Stay on top of suppliers.</strong> Ideally this is something you addressed before the holiday season got underway. If a main supplier encounters a problem that interrupts or slows production, that then becomes your problem. Try to diversify your suppliers so you’re not dependent on just one. This will keep you nimble during the holiday rush. Also, stay on top of your suppliers. Late deliveries could leave you with excess stock that could force you to take post-holiday markdowns.</p>
<p><strong>Update content.</strong> You should have holiday-themed blog posts up or ready to go. Have you embedded links back to your bestsellers in them? You should have. Review your homepage and product pages and spruce up content by adding synonyms and keywords customers are searching for. Consider creating or updating a gift guide. These simplify the shopping experience and let you put your bestsellers front and center. </p>
<p><strong>Reach out to local press.</strong> National print magazines have already moved on to planning January and February issues, but you might have a shot at getting some coverage in your local news outlets, which could give you added visibility when you need it.</p>
<p><strong>Get serious on social.</strong> Social media is a great tool to boost holiday sales. Try offering a social-media only promotion or holding a contest online. You’ll have to make your deals incredibly tempting, but if you’ve got low-performing inventory you want to move, consider bundling it into gifts or offering a giveaway with a certain purchase level.</p>
<p><strong>Have communication ready in case of unforeseen events.</strong> Some things are simply out of your control: no one expects you to stop snowstorms or strikes. However, they do expect you to troubleshoot and communicate. Have an email ready to send explaining that you’re doing your best to work around whatever incident has arisen. You’ll be able to fill in a few more details just before you send it. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The sales process used to be fairly simple, generating data that was easy to visualize and track. But ecommerce changed all that. Today, an online purchase generates a storm of data that can be used to improve sales performance—if you know how to harness it. Large companies have understood this and invest in exploiting that data. Small businesses can reap the benefits from this information as well, although they have to be a bit more nimble in doing so, given their limited human and financial resources. Here are a few ideas for how small businesses can go beyond simply monitoring data and turn it into a competitive advantage, especially for identifying actions during key sales periods.<br />
<span id="more-20912"></span></p>
<h2 style="color:#59bbc4">Identify patterns</h2>
<p>Finding patterns in data starts with monitoring activity, but it doesn’t end there. The key to making the most of data is to look for patterns: What are your customers buying? How are they finding it? Are they coming back? How much are they spending? Can you get them to spend more, and more often? </p>
<p>It helps to think of sales and marketing processes in terms of funnels. You might send 1,000 emails for a campaign that result in 10 recipients buying something. What happens along the way and why, is crucial to helping you determine what to change in your process in order to better respond to your customers. </p>
<p>Here’s an example of a typical email campaign funnel:</p>
<ol>
<li>You send 1,000 past customers an email promoting your holiday sale.</li>
<li>Of the 1,000 sent, 980 are delivered by your email service.</li>
<li>Of the 980 delivered, 325 are opened by past customers.</li>
<li>Of the 325 opened, 40 click on a product link in the email.</li>
<li>Of the 40 that clicked, 35 add a product to their shopping cart.</li>
<li>Of the 35 that add products to their shopping cart, 8 follow through with the purchase.</li>
</ol>
<p>Having data about each “narrowing” of the funnel helps you understand where problems may be occurring and where to focus your efforts and resources. </p>
<p>To a see a real shift in business requires consolidating the data gathered from monitoring, analyzing the results over time, and testing variations on strategy to see what happens. Any time is the perfect time to start gathering and analyzing data, but the holiday season is a particularly good time because it’s such a heavy-hitting time of year and ideally you’ll want to improve your performance each year. </p>
<h2 style="color:#59bbc4">Set goals</h2>
<p>It helps to have a goal in order to determine if what you’re doing is working and if it’s even right for your business. For example, are you trying to increase traffic? Boost sales? Reduce customer service calls? In order to test and monitor for these goals, you’ll want to establish a set of key performance indicators, or KPIs, to guide your analysis. Here are a few ideas to get you started thinking about what KPIs to focus on:</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Increase Site Traffic 25%<br />
<strong>KPIs:</strong> site traffic, sources, click-through rates, social shares, bounce rates. </p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Increase Sales 10%<br />
<strong>KPIs:</strong> Daily sales, conversion rate, site traffic</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Increase conversions 5%<br />
<strong>KPIs:</strong> Conversion rate, shopping cart abandonment rate, competitive price trends. </p>
<h2 style="color:#59bbc4">Test your ideas</h2>
<p>Split testing is a small business owner’s best friend. Once you’ve decided what your goal is and what KPIs you’re going to focus on, you can start getting scientific about how you’re going to get there. Start by identifying different page layouts for product pages and split testing them to see what resonates most with your customers. You can do the same thing with email campaigns and social media projects. </p>
<p>Here are a few examples of things to test on your website: </p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li>Product images</li>
<li>Product descriptions</li>
<li>Call to action button text</li>
<li>Call to action button position</li>
</ul>
<p>Google Trends is a great place to start identifying what’s relevant in your market via the volume and popularity of searches in your field. This can inform your business from a supply and demand perspective, but also give you ideas for content and specific wording to test throughout your site, email campaigns and social media actions.</p>
<h2 style="color:#59bbc4">Tools and resources</h2>
<p>You might be thinking, okay, monitoring and analyzing is great, but how do I manage all that information? Google Analytics is a great place to start. You can run your split tests through their “experiments” function to see which changes work and which don’t. The results are not always what you’d expect, which is why it’s so interesting to perform this kind of test. Having <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/63-analytics-stats-prestashop-modules" target="_blank">all your data consolidated in one place</a> is also necessary if you’re going to draw any useful conclusions. </p>
<p>You should also think about how you’re going to divide your marketing budget between customer segments. While acquisition should be an important part of your marketing budget, returning customers are actually more valuable in the long run. They are more likely to refer your brand and draw viral attention to it. You can invest in them by sending simple gifts, getting in touch with them via phone or email, or following up with special offers or coupons. By dividing your customers into segments (returning and new) you can test these initiatives and see what spurs repeat spending and increased spending. </p>
<h2 style="color:#59bbc4">Social media</h2>
<p>Social media creates a lot of data, but it can be difficult to tell what is driving conversions and what is giving you longer term visibility without necessarily resulting in immediate conversions. Facebook Insights and a platform like Hootsuite for Twitter can help you get a handle on these numbers and evaluate your activities on social media. <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/39-social-commerce-facebook-prestashop-modules" target="_blank">The PrestaShop Addons marketplace features a variety of modules</a> designed to give merchants insight into their marketing efforts, including on social media. </p>
<p>Data can be an incredible competitive advantage for small businesses that understand how to use it. Setting goals, identifying KPIs and regularly testing are the first steps to better data management. Resources like Google Trends, Google Analytics and social media tools like Hootsuite all provide free or low-cost ways to manage data, so there’s no reason to wait to start gathering and analyzing your data! </p>
